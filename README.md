# Ani-Scorer 

Have hundreds of Animes (or Mangas) that you finished but didn't score?

Don't know where to start? This makes scoring a fun activity by presenting two titles side by side and making you choose in a head-to-head style battle!

Gets your watchlist from [anilist](https://anilist.co), suggests scores based on your ranking and automatically saves them to anilist if you want to!
